## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ecommerce_site
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # Activate on Windows:
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   # Activate on macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Apply database migrations:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Create a superuser (for admin access):**
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

2. **Access the site:**
   Open your browser and navigate to localhost

3. **Admin Panel:**
   Access the Django admin dashboard at `localhost+port/admin/` to manage products and categories.

4. **Control Panel:**
   Access the control panel at `localhost+port/control-panel/` to manage products and categories.
## Project Structure

- `core/`: Project configuration and settings.
- `shop/`: Core e-commerce logic (products, cart, orders).
- `accounts/`: User authentication and profile management.
- `static/`: CSS, JavaScript, and other frontend assets.
- `media/`: User-uploaded product images.

## Production Warning: When you deploy to Vercel, remember that Vercel's file system is read-only. This means images uploaded through the admin panel will disappear after a few minutes.
## Solution: For production, you will eventually need to connect an external storage service like Cloudinary or AWS S3 (which is very common for Django apps). For now, during local development, it will work perfectly using your local media folder.
